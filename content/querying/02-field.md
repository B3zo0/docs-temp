# Query by fields

# Define searcheable fields

You can define which fields should be saved to the index with mark them in the related content type at the chosen field's definition.

It is also possible to switch off indexing for certain content types. In that case nobody will be able to find the instances made with those content types using queries, and the index will be smaller.

# Query by a text field

// shortext
// longtext

# Query by a number field

# Query by a boolean field
