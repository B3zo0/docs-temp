Sharing in sensenet (like many other features of the Content Repository) is built around the concept of content. As sensenet content items are stored in a huge tree, it is easy to share not only a single content (like a document) but a whole folder or a workspace with other users.

# Share via username

<tab category="sharing" article="sharing" example="byUsername" />

# Share via email

<tab category="sharing" article="sharing" example="byEmail" />

# Using sharing levels

<tab category="sharing" article="sharing" example="sharingLevels" />

# Remove sharing

<tab category="sharing" article="sharing" example="removeSharing" />

# Content shared with a specific user

Since the useras are saved as references on the shared content, you can easily get them requesting the content and querying by the SharedWith field.

In the following example you can see how to get the list of contents shared with the current user:

<tab category="sharing" article="sharing" example="sharedWidth" />
